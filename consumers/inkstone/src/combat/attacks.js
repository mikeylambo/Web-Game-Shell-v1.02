/**
 * `trail` is the fan/ribbon ink colour. Consecutive strokes deliberately
 * alternate sumi / vermilion so a string reads as separate marks rather than
 * one smear — the V0.2 palette had drifted to near-identical greys.
 *
 * `ink` is the V0.3 stroke this attack lays on the floor, authored here in the
 * same place as the trail rather than derived from the animation. Fields:
 *
 *   kind     'arc' (a swept slash) or 'line' (a straight mark)
 *   type     the registry stroke type — what V0.4's glyph checks match on
 *   reach    metres: arc radius, or total length of a line
 *   sweep    radians of arc (arc only)
 *   tilt     radians the arc is swung off the facing axis (arc only), so
 *            consecutive swings fan out instead of repainting one line
 *   lateral  metres of sideways tilt (line only) — what makes a diagonal read
 *   offset   metres forward of the attacker before the mark is placed
 *   width    ink weight in metres
 *   pillar   a Set mark that blocks a charge (grounded heavy and dive only)
 *
 * `ink: null` means the attack leaves nothing. Airborne attacks leave nothing:
 * ink touches the floor when the blade does. The dive is the exception, and it
 * is exactly the attack that ends on the ground.
